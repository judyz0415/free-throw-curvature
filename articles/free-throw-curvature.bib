	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between optimal basketball release angles and individual release distributions and whether individuals seek their optimal or minimum velocity release strategy. Sixteen male basketball players (height 183 ± 9 cm, age 22.6 ± 7 years) were recorded shooting 75 three-point shots. Ball release angle and velocity estimates were used in a nonparametric kernel density estimator (KDE) to identify individual-specific release distributions and optimal release angles. Optimal releases varied among individuals and were 4.3 ± 2.1° higher than minimum velocity releases. Mean release angles were 3.9° higher than the minimum velocity angle (p {\textless} 0.001) and only 0.4° below the optimal (p = 0.5). Participants skewed their probability density function (PDF) peaks 0.24° towards the optimal (p = 0.044) further indicating participants seek optimal rather than minimum velocity releases. Individual-specific optimal release angles were strongly correlated with their PDF covariance (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.001) and weakly correlated to the principal axis aspect ratio (r = −0.40, p = 0.137). These findings illustrate that optimal releases varied among participants and performance may be maximised by each athlete matching their release strategy to their PDF characteristics rather than matching a predetermined optimal release angle.},

About 20\% of all points were scored from free-throws. Free-throws comprised a significantly higher percentage of total points scored during the last 5 minutes than the first 35 minutes of the game for both winning and losing teams. Also, in the last 5 minutes of 246 games decided by 9 points or less and 244 decided by 10 points or more, winners scored a significantly higher percentage of points from free-throws than did losers. Suggestions for structuring practice conditions are discussed.},

	abstract = {During the shooting motion of a basketball, the path of the ball from the beginning of the lift to release follows an S-shaped trajectory. This study is the first to investigate how two distinctive features of the S-shaped ball path, the maximum curvature, κmax, and terminal curvature, σ, are associated with longitudinal accuracy. The sagittal plane ball path and curvature were found using Bezier curves for 31 professional male basketball athletes. Terminal release curvature had a very strong positive correlation to intra-individual release velocity standard deviation (r = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001) indicating that shooters with straighter terminal ball paths had better longitudinal shooting accuracy. It was also observed that κmax coincided with the transition to the forward shooting motion and that players with higher κmax tend to have a clear two-part shooting style rather than a single fluid motion. A comparison between groups of good and poor shooters identified a mean difference in κmax of 7.9 m−1 (p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI: 11.8–4.0 m−1) suggesting that good shooters typically have a higher κmax than poor shooters.},

	doi = {10.1080/02640414.2010.487872},
	abstract = {Magnitudes and timings of kinematic variables have often been used to investigate technique. Where large inter-participant differences exist, as in basketball, analysis of intra-participant variability may provide an alternative indicator of good technique. The aim of the present study was to investigate the joint kinematics and coordination-variability between missed and successful (swishes) free throw attempts. Collegiate level basketball players performed 20 free throws, during which ball release parameters and player kinematics were recorded. For each participant, three misses and three swishes were randomly selected and analysed. Margins of error were calculated based on the optimal-minimum-speed principle. Differences in outcome were distinguished by ball release speeds statistically lower than the optimal speed (misses −0.12 ± 0.10m · s−1; swishes −0.02 ± 0.07m · s−1; P {\textless} 0.05). No differences in wrist linear velocity were detected, but as the elbow influences the wrist through velocity-dependent-torques, elbow–wrist angle–angle coordination-variability was quantified using vector-coding and found to increase in misses during the last 0.016s before ball release (P {\textless} 0.05). As the margin of error on release parameters is small, the coordination-variability is small, but the increased coordination-variability just before ball release for misses is proposed to arise from players perceiving the technique to be inappropriate and trying to correct the shot. The synergy or coupling relationship between the elbow and wrist angles to generate the appropriate ball speed is proposed as the mechanism determining success of free-throw shots in experienced players.},

	doi = {10.1080/026404197367137},
	abstract = {Using a theoretical approach, we studied the basketball free throw as a function of angle, speed and spin at release. The ball was constrained to the sagittal plane bisecting the hoop and normal to the backboard, and was permitted to bounce and change spin on both backboard and hoop. Combinations of angle, speed and spin resulting in a successful shot were calculated analytically. Standard deviations for a shooter's angle and speed were used to predict the optimal trajectory for a specific position of release. An optimal trajectory was predicted which had an initial angle and speed of approximately 60 and 7.3 m s -1 respectively over the domain of spins (-2 to +2 m s -1 surface speed; -16 to +16 rad s 1 ). The effect of air resistance and the sagittal plane constraint on the predicted optimal trajectory were discussed and quantified. The optimal trajectory depended on both the anthropometric characteristics and accuracy of the shooter, but generally a high backspin with an angle and speed combination which sent the ball closer to the far rim of the basket than the near rim was advantageous. We provide recommendations for shooters as a function of the height of ball release.},

Transitory changes in the basketball free-throw shot were examined across different stages in skill development. Six female basketball players were selected, representing a range of playing expertise (pretest: 0–90\% baskets scored). Each participant was video recorded performing 30 shots. Contrary to predictions, there was not a clear pattern of a reduction in trajectory variability with increasing skill level. However, improvements in skill level were associated with an increasing amount of intertrial movement consistency from the elbow and wrist joints. It is suggested that the angular motions of the elbow and wrist joints were compensated for each other toward the end of each throw to adapt to subtle changes in release parameters of the ball.},

	abstract = {This study attempts to analyze the relationship between free-throw efficiency and the time of arm muscle activation in players from 3 basketball teams with different levels of experience was investigated. During the experiment each player made 20 free throws during which the activation time of his right and left biceps and triceps brachii muscles were measured with the use of surface electromyography and high-speed cameras. Significant differences in muscle activation time (t) during a free throw were found between the groups of basketball players (p = 0.038) (novices: t = 0.664 ± 0.225 s, intermediate-level players: t = 1.15 ± 0.146 s, experts: t = 1.01 ± 0.388 s). In the right triceps brachii muscle in expert basketball players the coefficient of variation (CV) amounted to 44.60\% at 81\% efficiency, and in novices to 27.12\% at 53\% efficiency. The time of arm muscle activation during a free throw and its fluctuations vary along with the training experience of basketball players. In all studied groups of players, the variability of muscle activation time in accurate free throws is greater than in inaccurate free throws. Free-throw speed is irrelevant for free-throw efficiency.},

Five release variables were studied: release height, release speed, launch angle, side angle, and back spin. The free throw shooter was assumed to shoot at 70\% and to release the ball 2.134 m (7 ft) above the ground. We found that the shooter should place up to 3 Hz of back spin on the ball, should aim the ball towards the back of the ring, and should launch the ball at 52° to the horizontal. We also found that it is desirable to release the ball as high above the ground as possible, as long as this does not adversely affect the player's launch consistency.},
